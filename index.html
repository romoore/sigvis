        <h1>Signal Visualization (SigVis) for the Owl Platform</h1>

<p>This application is a simple Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) containing several simple visualizations of wireless sensor network signal data gathered via the Owl Platform.  Visualizing sensor signal data can assist in debugging sensor failures, analyzing the overall effectiveness of the system, and aid in designing new applications.</p>

<h1>What it Does</h1>

<p>SigVis is a set of visualization tools for monitoring or exploring wireless
sensor networks, particularly the received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
values reported by wireless cards.  This data is available for nearly every
wireless technology, most commonly by IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) family of protocols.
By visualizing the data in both time and space, new observations and insights
are made possible.  Let's take a look at the different visualizations.</p>

<p>If you feel like trying out the app, but don't have access to an Owl
Platform installation, I've provided a <a
href="data/sigvis-winlab-demo.svch">sample file</a> for you to view.  It
contains data collected from the WINLAB laboratory (where a lot of work
related to the Owl Platform takes place) on October 21, 2012.  There isn't a
lot going on, but it can give you an idea of what SigVis does.  The
screenshots below all use the same data file, with the time set to 9:01:02pm
(the last timestamp).</p>


<h2>RSSI Bar Chart</h2>
<p>A set of simple bar charts are used to display RSSI values or RSSI variance
values for a transmitter or receiver. For the transmitter shown below, data
was available from only a small number of receivers, which is why there are
some "empty" spaces.
</p>

  <tr>

      Transmitter 38" /></a></div>
      <div class="caption"><p>A bar chart showing the current RSSI value for
      Transmitter 38 as observed by different receivers.  The receiver names (as
      defined in the World Model) are written vertically on the blue RSSI
      bars.</p>

</table>

<h2>RSSI Line Graph</h2>
<p>A set of line graphs showing values over time.  Depending on the data, the
graphs will auto-scale th vertical axis, and scaling on the horizontal axis is
performed by using the mouse wheel.  The most recent values are on the right,
with older values drawn to the left.</p> 
<p> When connected to a live World Model data stream, the values will
auto-scroll from right to left. Scrolling is stopped and started by
left-clicking anywhere on the graph.</p>

      <div class="caption"><p>A line graph showing the last 60 seconds of RSSI
      variance values for Transmitter 38. The "spike" from Receiver 652
      indicates that either the receiver was moving (unlikely) or someone was
      moving nearby the receiver.</p></div>

      <div class="caption"><p>A line graph showing combined RSSI and standard
      deviation in the same plot.  The "thick" areas are centered at the
      current RSSI and above and below to one standard deviation.</p></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>RSSI Stripes</h2>
<p>A somewhat different graph from the RSSI lines above, this one displays the
RSSI value for each transmitter/receiver pair over a period of time.  To
provide a simple, if imprecise, measure of the RSSI value, the color of each
line ranges from red (low) to green (medium) to pink (high) to provide an intuition about the
RSSI value. When displaying RSSI Variance instead of RSSI, the same colors are
used to display the variance value, varying from 0 to 40+.</p>

<p>Clustered based on receivers, this graph can be used to spot problematic
receivers or transmitters by identifying a block of reddish lines, or a red
line in the same relative position for each receiver.  It can also be used to
quickly get an idea of how much data has been sent through the system over the
last few minutes</p>

  <tr>
    <td><div class="screenshot"><a href="images/all-rssi-stripes.png"><img

      <div class="caption"><p>RSSI stripes plot showing RSSI values for the last
      60 seconds for all transmitter-receiver pairs.  Reddish colors indicate
      low RSSI values and bluish colors indicate high RSSI values.</p></div>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div class="screenshot"><a href="images/all-var-stripes.png"><img

    transmitter-receiver pairs"></a></div>
    <div class="caption"><p>RSSI variance stripes plot showing values for the
    last 60 seconds for all transmitter-receiver pairs.  The cluster of
    blue-pink colors across multiple receivers, but around the same point in
    time, suggests motion was occurring within the building.</p></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>RSSI Line Maps</h2>
<p>The "map" visualizations show wireless sensor data overlayed on an image
map of the space.  The map can be configured into the World Model as a URL
anywhere accessible to the application.  For these screenshots, we used the <a
href="data/sigvis-winlab-demo.svch">example file</a>, which requires access to
a Rutgers University web host in order to download the building image.</p>

<p>This RSSI and variance line maps show the RSSI and RSSI variance data for
each transmitter-receiver pair as a line drawn between the locations of the
two devices.  The line is colored similarly to the "stripes" plots, where red
indicates "low" values, green is "medium", and blue or pink is "high".</p>

  <tr>
    <td><div class="screenshot"><a href="images/all-rssi-lines-map.png"><img

    <div class="caption"><p>An RSSI line map showing the WINLAB building with
    transmitter-receiver pairings.  Red lines are weak RSSI values, and blue

    pairs in the WINLAB building. The red lines are the lowest variance, and
    blue or pink lines indicate high variance.  </p></div>

<h2>Voronoi Signal Maps</h2>
<p>By partitioning the physical layout of the area into a Voronoi diagram,
with transmitters and/or receivers as vertices, a rough but intuitive
estimate of signal levels throughout the area is possible. A Voronoi diagram
is by no means an optimal representation of signal propagation
characteristics, but it provides a simple way to view the area.  </p>

<p>Within each "cell" of the diagram, the value displayed is directly related
to the transmitter or receiver at the center of that cell. For example, in a
full RSSI diagram (all transmitters and receivers), the color of a
transmitter's cell might be the maximum RSSI value received FOR that
transmitter BY a receiver.   In these maps, as with many others, the color
codes indicate different signal levels: red is "weak", green is "moderate",
blue is "high", and  pink is "highest".</p>

      <div class="caption"><p>A Voronoi map showing the maximum RSSI values for

<h2>Signal-to-Distance Ring Maps</h2>
<p>When enough transmitters and receivers are in known locations and not
moving (perhaps attached to fixed objects), a rough estimate of
signal-to-distance for the environment can be created.  For a transmitter, its
current RSSI (signal) value is used to estimate its distance to all of the
receivers.  Rings are drawn out from each receiver; the inner radius is the
shortest predicted distance and the outer radius is the longest predicted
distance.</p>

<p>While these maps can be used for "eyeing" the location of an object, they
also demonstrate just how hard it is to to perform indoor localization and
tracking.  In general, weak links will mispredict the distance more often
than short links.  Additionally, indoor environments are full of objects that
cause complex multi-path scenarios.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><div class="screenshot"><a href="images/tx-rssi-rings.png"><img
    src="images/tx-rssi-rings.png" alt="RSSI Ring Map for Transmitter 38."
    title="RSSI Ring Map for Transmitter 38" /></a></div>
    <div class="caption"><p>RSSI ring map for transmitter 38.  The rings are
    centered around receivers that can receive 38's beacons.  Note how many of
    the receivers completely mispredict the distance to 38; an effect caused
    by multiple paths traveled by the radio waves.</p></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Ambient Motion</h2>
<p>The ambient motion visualization uses RSSI variance information to estimate
how much motion is occurring in the environment.  Each time the variance
exceeds a set threshold level (2-3), a "cloud" is drawn on the screen.  When
multiple receivers experience this increase in variance, more clouds are
drawn.  This is not intended to be a precise tool, but rather to allow users
to quickly intuit how busy the area is without having to read complex
graphs.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="screenshot"><a href="images/ambient-night.png"><img
      src="images/ambient-night.png" alt="Ambient motion during an evening
      when 1 person is walking around" title="Ambient motion during an evening
      when 1 person is walking around" /></a></div>
      <div class="caption"><p>Ambient motion for a relatively quiet evening at
      WINLAB.  The screen is darkened to give the impression of nighttime, and
      a few clouds pass across the screen.  In this case, a single person was
      moving around for several seconds.  The tail-end of this motion is
      visible near the left side of the screen. The few other clouds are
      likely from "left over" motion or the person settling in their seat.</p></div>
