        <h1>Signal Visualization (SigVis) for Owl Platform</h1>

<p>This application is a simple Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) containing several simple visualizations of wireless sensor network signal data gathered via the Owl Platform.  Visualizing sensor signal data can assist in debugging sensor failures, analyzing the overall effectiveness of the system, and aid in designing new applications.</p>

<h1>What it Does</h1>

<p>SigVis is a set of visualization tools for monitoring or exploring wireless
sensor networks, particularly the received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
values reported by wireless cards.  This data is available for nearly every
wireless technology, most commonly by IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) family of protocols.
By visualizing the data in both time and space, new observations and insights
are made possible.  Let's take a look at the different visualizations.</p>

<p>If you feel like trying out the app, but don't have access to an Owl
Platform installation, I've provided a <a
href="data/sigvis-winlab-demo.svch">sample file</a> for you to view.  It
contains data collected from the WINLAB laboratory (where a lot of work
related to the Owl Platform takes place) on October 21, 2012.  There isn't a
lot going on, but it can give you an idea of what SigVis does.  The
screenshots below all use the same data file, with the time set to 9:01:02pm
(the last timestamp).</p>


<h2>RSSI Bar Chart</h2>
<p>A set of simple bar charts are used to display RSSI values or RSSI variance
values for a transmitter or receiver. For the transmitter shown below, data
was available from only a small number of receivers, which is why there are
some "empty" spaces.
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="screenshot"><a href="images/rssi-bar.png"><img src="images/rssi-bar.png"
      alt="RSSI Bar Chart for Transmitter 38" title="RSSI Bar Chart for
      Transmitter 38" /></a></div>
      <div class="caption"><p>A bar chart showing the current RSSI value for
      Transmitter 38 as observed by different receivers.  The receiver names (as
      defined in the World Model) are written vertically on the blue RSSI
      bars.</p>

      for Transmitter 38 as observed by various receivers.</p>
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>RSSI Line Graph</h2>
<p>A set of line graphs showing values over time.  Depending on the data, the
graphs will auto-scale th vertical axis, and scaling on the horizontal axis is
performed by using the mouse wheel.  The most recent values are on the right,
with older values drawn to the left.</p> 
<p> When connected to a live World Model data stream, the values will
auto-scroll from right to left. Scrolling is stopped and started by
left-clicking anywhere on the graph.</p>

      <div class="caption"><p>A line graph showing the last 60 seconds of RSSI
      values for Transmitter 38 from various receivers. Receivers are

      <div class="caption"><p>A line graph showing the last 60 seconds of RSSI
      variance values for Transmitter 38. The "spike" from Receiver 652
      indicates that either the receiver was moving (unlikely) or someone was
      moving nearby the receiver.</p></div>
    </td>

      for Transmitter 38" /></a></div>
      <div class="caption"><p>A line graph showing combined RSSI and standard
      deviation in the same plot.  The "thick" areas are centered at the
      current RSSI and above and below to one standard deviation.</p></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>RSSI Stripes</h2>
<p>A somewhat different graph from the RSSI lines above, this one displays the
RSSI value for each transmitter/receiver pair over a period of time.  To
provide a simple, if imprecise, measure of the RSSI value, the color of each
line ranges from red (low) to green (medium) to pink (high) to provide an intuition about the
RSSI value. When displaying RSSI Variance instead of RSSI, the same colors are
used to display the variance value, varying from 0 to 40+.</p>

<p>Clustered based on receivers, this graph can be used to spot problematic
receivers or transmitters by identifying a block of reddish lines, or a red
line in the same relative position for each receiver.  It can also be used to
quickly get an idea of how much data has been sent through the system over the
last few minutes</p>

      <div class="caption"><p>RSSI stripes plot showing RSSI values for the last
      60 seconds for all transmitter-receiver pairs.  Reddish colors indicate
      low RSSI values and bluish colors indicate high RSSI values.</p></div>

    <div class="caption"><p>RSSI variance stripes plot showing values for the
    last 60 seconds for all transmitter-receiver pairs.  The cluster of
    blue-pink colors across multiple receivers, but around the same point in
    time, suggests motion was occurring within the building.</p></div>
