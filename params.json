Visualizing sensor signal data can assist in debugging sensor failures, analyzing the overall effectiveness of the system, and aid in designing new applications.\r\n\r\n#What it Does#\r\nSigVis is a set of visualization tools for monitoring or exploring wireless sensor networks, particularly the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values reported by wireless cards.  This data is available for nearly every wireless technology, most commonly by IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) family of protocols.  By visualizing the data in both time and space, new observations and insights are made possible.  Let's take a look at the different visualizations.\r\n\r\n##RSSI Bar Chart##\r\n\r\n##RSSI Line Graph##\r\n\r\n##RSSI Stripes##\r\n\r\n##RSSI Line Maps##\r\n\r\n##Voronoi Signal Maps##\r\n\r\n##Signal-to-Distance Ring Maps##\r\n\r\n##Ambient Motion##","name":"Sigvis","google":""}
