== About ==
  Owl Platform Signal Visualization Tools (SigVis) is a cross-platform graphical
  desktop application to assist developers and users of the Owl
  Platform in visualizing signal data from the system.  It
  focuses primarily on visualizing RSSI data from wireless transmitters and
  receivers in the system.

  SigVis is not aimed at end-users/consumers, and may contain bugs.
  Documentation is provided via the in-application Help menu.  For additional
  support or help, please visit the project website at the URL listed above.

== Compiling ==
  Before you compile SigVis for the first time, be sure to install the
  JAR files located in the "contrib" directory.  These are dependencies of the
  project, but must be manually installed to your local Maven repository since
  they are not tracked in any of the central repositories.  To install them,
  you can simply run the provided Bash script:

    ./install-lib.sh

  SigVis should be compiled using the Apache Maven project management tool.
  The project is currently compatible with Apache Maven version 3, which
  can be downloaded for free at <http://maven.apache.org/>.  To build the
  static JAR file output, the following command should be run from the
  project root (where the pom.xml file is located):

    mvn clean install -U

  If everything compiles correctly, then near the end of the Maven output,
  this line should appear:

    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

  In this case, the JAR file will be located in the ``target'' subdirectory.
  If not, please visit the project website listed at the top of this
  document for support.

== Running ==

  SigVis can be run from the provided Bash script (gui.sh) or via a direct
  call to the Java launcher (java or java.exe).

  To run from the script, change to the root directory (where gui.sh is
  located) and run the following command:

    ./gui.sh

  To run via the Java launcher directly, you only need to include the path to
  the Jar file:

    java -jar path/to/sigvis-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

  SigVis takes an optional set of parameters to connect to a remote Owl Platform
  World Model server on startup.  To do so, specify the World Model host/IP,
  client port, and a region name as commandline parameters:

    ./gui.sh grail.mydomain.com 7010 myregion

  or

    java -jar path/to/sigvis-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
      grail.mydomain.com 7010 myregion

  SigVis can also make use of driver-assisted rendering, which reduces the
  load on the CPU and allows for higher refresh rates.  To enable 2D
  acceleration from your graphics card, be sure that the JVM parameter
  "sun.java2d.opengl=true" is set. This can be done as follows:

    java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true -jar path/to/sigvis.jar 

  If you are using the provided Bash script, it will attempt to auto-detect
  accelerated graphics using the "glxinfo" utility.  If glxinfo is not
  available on your system, you may modify the script to force accelerated
  graphics.
